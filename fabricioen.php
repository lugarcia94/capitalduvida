  <p>Fabrício Guimarães is convinced that certainty alone doesn’t take you far. With a background in Marketing and a specialization in Business, he believes in living his truth fully—yet embracing change effortlessly when new experiences bring sharper clarity. That, to him, is the formula for a powerful life.</p>

  <p>Born in Uberlândia, Brazil, he hit the road early—first to the U.S., then São Paulo, and later Denmark, where he incubated a startup at Singularity University.</p>

  <p>A serial entrepreneur driven by curiosity, he’s passionate about art, design, the human mind, sports, travel—and a good banana pie. He co-founded his first company in 2013, is the proud father of Musa (a tech company transforming how waste is handled and managed), a partner at Be180 (a mediatech specializing in OOH), co-creator of Instituto Terra Livre, and founder of Like Me, a healthtech currently raising funds in the U.S.</p>

  <p>Around here, he’ll challenge perspectives, spark curiosity, and invite you to explore new possibilities—letting go of limits and embracing life on your own terms.</p>
  <p>“My goal with Capital da Dúvida is to show paths for people, enabling them to discover and walk their own way—free from limitations”. Fabrício.</p>

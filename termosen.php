If you want to exercise any of these rights, please send an email to contato@capitaldaduvida.com and we will fulfill your request as soon as possible. If you contact us to exercise any of these rights, we will need to access your corresponding personal data to fulfill your requests.</p>

  <p><strong>5.2 Right of rectification.</strong> This right allows you, at any time, to request the correction and/or rectification of your personal data if you identify that some of them are incorrect. However, to be effective, we will need to check the validity of the data you provide us.</p>
  <p><strong>5.3 Right of deletion.</strong> This right allows you to request the deletion of the personal data we hold about you. All collected data will be deleted from our servers when you request it or when they are no longer necessary or relevant to offer you our services, except if there is any other reason for their maintenance, such as a legal obligation to retain data.</p>
  <p><strong>5.4 Right to object to processing.</strong> You also have the right to contest where and in what context we are processing your personal data for different purposes. In certain situations, we may demonstrate that we have legitimate reasons to process your data, which override your rights, for example, if they are essential for providing our applications.</p>
  <p><strong>5.5 Right to request anonymization, blocking, or deletion.</strong> This right allows you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the accuracy of the data; (b) when you need the data to be maintained even if we no longer need them, as necessary, to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (c) if you have objected to the use of your data, but in this case, we need to verify if we have legitimate reasons to use them.</p>
  <p><strong>5.6 Right to portability.</strong> We will provide you, or a third party you choose, with your personal data in a structured and interoperable format.</p>
  <p><strong>5.7 Right to withdraw your consent.</strong> You have the right to withdraw your consent regarding the terms of this Privacy Policy. However, this will not affect the legality of any processing carried out previously. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services.</p>
  <p><strong>5.8 Right to review automated decisions.</strong> You also have the right to request a review of decisions made solely based on automated processing of your personal data that affect your interests, including decisions aimed at defining personal, professional, consumer, and credit profiles and/or aspects of your personality.</p>
  <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise your other rights).
